    "# INTRODUCTION\n",

    "Regression analysis is a statistical technique that is used to predict a continuous variable from one or more independent variables. The dependent variable is the variable that is being predicted, and the independent variables are the variables that are used to predict the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this machine learning regression project, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. The model is developed by training the algorithm on a dataset of historical data. The algorithm learns from the data and identifies patterns that can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for new data points. This can be used to make decisions about future outcomes, such as predicting sales, forecasting demand, or assessing risk."

    "This is a time series forecasting problem. In this project, we'll predict store sales on data from **Corporation Favorita**, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.\n",

    "Specifically, we are to build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.\n",

    "The training data includes dates, store, and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models"
